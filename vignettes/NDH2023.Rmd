# The mathematics behind HeiDI
Navarro et al. [-@navarro_prediction_2023] presented a time-based 
extension of HeiDI [@honey_heidi_2020], equipping the model
with an intensity-based generalization mechanism that enables
it to respond across time.


## 0 - Stimulus decay

The model assumes that the perceived intensity of a stimulus decays across time, and
each of those intensities is represented as an independent compound 
(in the complete serial compound sense, see [TD](TD.html)). The intensity of 
stimulus $i$ on epoch $e$ is given by:

$$
\tag{Eq. 1}
\alpha_i^e = \alpha_i^{e-1} * (1 -)
$$
